Due to GitHub's dataset size limitations and the fact that CVEfixes and CodeNet are public datasets, the datasets for CodeNet and CVEfixes are not stored here. You can obtain them from the respective CVEfixes and CodeNet papers. Details on how these datasets are processed can be found in our paper.
